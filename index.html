        <h1>FOOTBALL</h1>
      <body>Football is a team sport played between two teams of 11 players each, 
            including one goalkeeper per team.  The goal is simple: score more goals than the
             opponent by getting the ball into their net using 
            any part of the body except the hands and arms (only the goalkeeper can use hands, within the penalty area)</h5>
        Football, also known as soccer in some countries, is the world’s most popular and widely played sport, enjoyed by millions of players and billions of fans across the globe. 
        It is a team game played between two sides of eleven players each, including a goalkeeper, on a rectangular field with a goal at each end. The main objective of the game is to score goals by getting the ball into the opposing team’s net using any part of the body except the hands and arms, with only the goalkeeper allowed to handle the ball within the penalty area. 
      footlball  is governed internationally by the Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), which organizes major competitions such as the FIFA World Cup — the most prestigious and watched sporting event in the world. The game emphasizes teamwork, strategy, skill, and physical endurance, with players displaying techniques such as dribbling, passing, shooting, and defending. Originating in England in the 19th century, football has evolved into a universal sport that transcends language, culture, and nationality, uniting people through passion, competition, and shared excitement. Whether played professionally in massive stadiums or casually in streets and fields, football continues to inspire and bring together communities worldwide.
Football, often called “the beautiful game,” is much more than just a sport — it is a global phenomenon that influences culture, identity, and society.
 Played by people of all ages, genders, and backgrounds, it serves as a unifying force that bridges differences and fosters friendship and teamwork. 
 The game is played on a rectangular field, usually made of grass or artificial turf, with dimensions typically around 100–110 meters long and 64–75 meters wide. 
 A standard match lasts 90 minutes, divided into two halves of 45 minutes each, with a short halftime break. If the score is tied in knockout competitions, extra time or a penalty shootout may decide the winner.
Each team is made up of different positions, including forwards who focus on scoring, midfielders who control the flow of the game, defenders who protect their goal, and the goalkeeper who prevents the opposing team from scoring. The sport requires not only physical strength, speed, and stamina but also mental skills such as quick decision-making, tactical awareness, and teamwork. Famous players like Pelé, Diego Maradona, Lionel Messi, and Cristiano Ronaldo have become global icons, inspiring generations with their talent and dedication.
Football has deep cultural and economic importance — it drives billion-dollar industries, from professional leagues such as the English Premier League, La Liga, Serie A, and the UEFA Champions League, to sponsorships, broadcasting, and merchandise. The FIFA World Cup, held every four years, brings together nations in a celebration of skill, pride, and unity, making it the most watched sporting event worldwide. Beyond the professional level, football plays a vital social role: it promotes health, teaches discipline, and offers hope and opportunity to youth in every corner of the world.
 Whether played on a grand stage or in a neighborhood park, football remains a symbol of passion, perseverance, and global unity.
